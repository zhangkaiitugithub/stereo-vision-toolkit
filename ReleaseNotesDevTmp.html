Stereo Vision Toolkit v1.3.1.3 [Development release]

Changes:
- Fix 'OK' button in calibration dialog is enabled in unstable state
- Fix loading 5 images in calibration dialog causes crash
- Fix unclear error messages in calibration failure

Known Issues:
- ROS perception YAML's data arrays must be on single line in YAML file.
- WLS filter causes speckle filter to sometimes be disabled.
- Stereo videos are saved uncompressed to avoid lossy compression which would cause issues when loading stereo videos. This will create large file sizes.
